Discord bot to manage an EVE Online Corp/Alliance discord "guild".

Current Version - 1.0-Beta   
Should be fairly stable.

Known Bugs
- Bot may DC from channel. It will still perform all the background tasks and post messages it just can't receive chat commands. Restart is the only fix ATM. Working on resolving this.

Have a look at the [Wiki for info](https://github.com/shibdib/EVE-Discord-Bot/wiki)


Or jump into the [MAMBA Discord](https://discord.gg/0qsFaq4lpZHWX0pB) and ask around for Mr Twinkie

The Affirmative alliance version of this bot has several distinct differences from the original bot:

- Nickname=character name is enforced, instead of username=character name
- There is now the ability to automatically add alliance ticker to the end of nickname 
- Multiple alliances can be added to the auth system, instead of just one alliance
- Several bug fixes and code optimizations have been done.
