BOT IS DEPREACEATED!!

Known Bugs
- Bot may DC from channel. It will still perform all the background tasks and post messages it just can't receive chat commands. Restart is the only fix ATM. Working on resolving this.

Have a look at the [Wiki for info](https://github.com/shibdib/EVE-Discord-Bot/wiki)


Or jump into the [MAMBA Discord](https://discord.gg/0qsFaq4lpZHWX0pB) and ask around for Mr Twinkie
